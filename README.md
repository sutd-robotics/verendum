<img src="assets/MOMO_logo_full.png" width="400px"/>

MOMObot (MOdular MObile Robot) is a ROS enabled autonomous ground vehicle for service by the SUTD Organisation of Autonomous Robotics (**SOAR**)!

### [SUTDoggo](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/SUTDoggo) üêï
An adaptation of the Stanford Doggo Project for SUTD SOAR.

### [Jessica Arm](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/JESSICA-SOAR)
JESSICA is a robot arm that can automatically serve coffee upon activation. We plan to add a manual function, where users can control JESSICA with an EMG myosensor armband. ‚òï

## Completed/Archived

### [Gazebo Model](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/momobot_gazebo)
![momo_gazebo_logo](assets/momo_gz_logo.png)

Tested on Gazebo9, the model is used to simulate MOMOBot with various packages and algorithms in a virtual environment.

### [Waypointgen](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/waypointgen)
![wpgen_logo](assets/wpgen.jpg)

A waypoint generator (using InteractiveMarkers in Rviz) and a waypoint server for waypoint playback.

### [NeoPixel Display](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/ROS-NeoMatrix-Scrolling-Text)
![neopixel_matrix](assets/momo_neopx.jpg)

A ROS package to display text and animation on a 8x8 *Neopixel* matrix with Arduino, attached onto the side of momobot. (Made up of 6 matrix display)

### [Machine Learning/AI](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/SOAR-ML)
Exploring MNIST digit recognition via Tensorflow & Keras, and to create a gesture detctor ROS package using the YOLO3 model.
