A ROS package to display text and animation on a 8x8 *Neopixel* matrix with Arduino. (Made up of 6 matrix display)

#### WebApp Interface
[Coming soon]

### [SUTDoggo](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/SUTDoggo) üêï
An adaptation of the Stanford Doggo Project for SUTD SOAR.

### [Jessica Arm](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/JESSICA-SOAR)
JESSICA is a robot arm that can automatically serve coffee upon activation. We plan to add a manual function, where users can control JESSICA with an EMG myosensor armband. ‚òï

### SAUVC 2019/20: [bubblesjr](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/bubblesjr)
Challenges participant teams to build an AUV which can perform AUV navigation, visual identification, acoustic localization and robotic manipulation.

### [Machine Learning/AI](https://github.com/sutd-robotics/SOAR-ML)
Exploring MNIST digit recognition via Tensorflow & Keras, and to create a gesture detctor ROS package using the YOLO3 model.

## Completed/Archived
